## Task

The goal of this task to create an applicant tracking system (ATS) in React. This applicant tracking system will consist of a list of jobs, as well as a detail page for each job with its applicants and their applications. The UX of the pages are up to you, so use your best judgement as to how to put the pages together.

## Evaluation

The task will be evaluated on code structure and quality, test quality, and page performance. UX will be judged based on logical flow, ease of use, for the end user, which in this case, will be a person on the "agency" side who is managing multiple clients. This test will not be evaluated on a UX for clients (who will create jobs), or talents (that will be applying for them).

## Details and Limitations

1. You must use functional components and hooks and the latest version of React.
1. Data must be editable, and saved to LocalStorage.
1. Prefill with dummy data of your choice, with at least 5 clients, 20 jobs, and 20 applicants each.
1. Deploy code in a working demo to Vercel.
